        <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
        <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates
          back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of
          state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this
          end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed
          territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
          approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the
          eighteenth-century public sphere.

          <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the
            press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
            constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these
            measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and
            Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

          <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often linked
            to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first
            freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and
            Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
            Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

          <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts
            (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
